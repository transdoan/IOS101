## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
  1. Health by Apple
     - Simple, but effective user interface that lists only useful data at first glance
     - Calculates your trends for you, makes it easier to extract information on your health
  2. Google Calendar
     - Intuitive use of the home screen, which just has a month-at-a-glance type of view that includes all your events, unlike Apple's calendar
     - Easy to link external calendars into my own
  3. My college's dining menu app called Yale Menus
     - Straightforward interface that like Health, only lists the different dining halls and their menus for that day
     - Allows for ratings, which makes it fun and useful to eliminate food items

  Idea:
    A broad topic that I would like to build an app in is organization. I'm currently thinking of perhaps making an app that lets you very simply record
    entertainment/art items like books, movies, and songs. It's like an outlet to store someone's thoughts on personal hobbies, almost. I would like the
    app to have features that enable labeling/grouping, flashbacks (think SnapChat's "This is where you were 4 years ago today" notifications), written 
    posts, tags, sharing (TBD), and customization with in-app stickers or colors. 

## Notes

I had a difficult time with the code implementation, especially debugging an error I got called "NSUnknownKeyException." 
I figured out, after a good 10 minutes, that the error was due to me naming the button as something other than 'changeBackgroundColor'.
